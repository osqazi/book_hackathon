# Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the **Humanoid Robotics Book** – your comprehensive guide to building intelligent humanoid robots from foundational concepts to cutting-edge autonomous systems.

## What You'll Learn

This book takes you on a journey through four essential modules:

### 📚 Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Learn the robotic nervous system – how ROS 2 enables humanoid robots to communicate, coordinate, and control complex movements.
- ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python integration with rclpy
- URDF robot modeling for humanoid structures

### 🎮 Module 2: Simulation & Digital Twins
Master virtual environments for safe, cost-effective robot development using Gazebo and Unity.
- Physics principles for humanoid simulation
- Sensor integration (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU, RGB)
- Digital Twin workflows for testing before deployment

### 🤖 Module 3: AI-Driven Perception (NVIDIA Isaac)
Unlock photorealistic simulation and AI-powered navigation with NVIDIA's Isaac platform.
- Isaac Sim for realistic sensor simulation
- Visual SLAM for humanoid navigation
- Nav2 path planning for bipedal robots
- Synthetic data generation and sim-to-real transfer

### 🧠 Module 4: Vision-Language-Action
Build autonomous humanoid systems that understand and execute natural language commands.
- LLM-driven task decomposition
- Whisper speech recognition integration
- Multimodal perception (vision + language + state)
- Complete VLA architecture for autonomous robots

## Learning Path

The modules are designed to build on each other:

```
ROS 2 Fundamentals (P1)
        ↓
Simulation & Digital Twins (P2)
        ↓
AI-Driven Perception (P3)
        ↓
Vision-Language-Action (P4)
```

**Prerequisites**: Basic Python programming knowledge (variables, functions, loops, classes)

## Who This Book Is For

- Robotics students seeking structured learning from basics to advanced AI
- Software engineers transitioning to robotics development
- AI researchers exploring embodied intelligence
- Hobbyists building humanoid robot projects
